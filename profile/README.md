# URI on GitHub

The University of Rhode Island uses WordPress, an open-source content management system that makes it efficient to build and maintain websites for all our institutional needs. Customizations we make to our WordPress installations are built here, on GitHub, and managed by the [Web Team](https://web.uri.edu/external-relations/contact-us/#web).

## :technologist: Contribute

If you'd like to be a part of development, many of our biggest respositories (like the [theme](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-modern) and [component library](https://github.com/uriweb/uri-component-library)) have a `CONTRIBUTING.md` to help you get started.  You can also learn more about [contributing to open-source projects](https://opensource.guide) in general.
